Training to become a software developer, with an interest in UI and UX.

I love French Pastries 🥐, Journalism ✏️+ Travelling around Earth’s Wild Places 🌊

Comfortable working in HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS. Knowledge of Git and Github (ofcourse). Soon to be learning Typescript and diving into frameworks like React (as of March/April 2022).

A proven portfolio of design skills with knowledge and practical skills working across design programmes like Adobe's creative suite, in particular AI, PS and XD.

Hoping to return to university in April this year (2022) to study an evening-based BSc degree in computer science.

Searching for a mentor, and to join a creative team of likeminded individuals within a company which offers growth and personal development.
